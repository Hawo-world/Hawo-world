### 😼 About

I’m **Harm**, Founder and Programmer of Hawo-world. | 🎓Masters Student Dual Majoring in Computer & Data Science.

Guided by a passion for leadership and innovation, I build, experiment, and share open-source projects focused on **cybersecurity, threat intelligence, & digital forensics.**.
“Technology is only as strong as the trust behind it.” With Hawo-world, I aim to bridge the gap between innovation and security—so progress doesn’t come at the cost of safety.
